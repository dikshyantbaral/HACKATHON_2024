          Welcome to मल Basket, a platform dedicated to fostering sustainable agricultural practices and building a bridge between Nepal's rural farmers and urban gardeners. We believe in creating a greener, more connected world by empowering farmers and supporting urban farming initiatives.

          At MAL Basket, we aim to tackle two pressing challenges in Nepal: the lack of market access for rural farmers to sell their organic manure and the growing demand for eco-friendly fertilizers among urban terrace farmers. By providing a seamless, user-friendly platform, we enable farmers to monetize their organic waste while helping urban gardeners grow healthier crops using sustainable resources.

          <br> Our mission is to promote a circular economy where organic resources are reused efficiently, contributing to environmental sustainability and economic resilience. We are committed to empowering rural communities, supporting urban agriculture, and fostering a culture of collaboration between villages and cities.

          Join us as we grow together — from rural roots to urban heights — for a sustainable and prosperous Nepal. Let’s cultivate a future where every farmer and every gardener thrives.
